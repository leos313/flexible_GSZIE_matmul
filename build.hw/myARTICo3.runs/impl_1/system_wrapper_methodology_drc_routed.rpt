Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin system_i/artico3_shuffler_0/U0/reset_gen[2].gbuff_rstgen.reset_buffer/I is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin system_i/artico3_shuffler_0/U0/reset_gen[3].gbuff_rstgen.reset_buffer/I is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin system_i/artico3_shuffler_0/U0/reset_gen[4].gbuff_rstgen.reset_buffer/I is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin system_i/artico3_shuffler_0/U0/reset_gen[5].gbuff_rstgen.reset_buffer/I is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-9#1 Advisory
BUFGCE with active CE has BUFG driver  
The BUFGCE cell system_i/artico3_shuffler_0/U0/clock_gen[0].gbuff_clkgen.clock_buffer system_i/artico3_shuffler_0/U0/clock_gen[0].gbuff_clkgen.clock_buffer/I pin (and CE is ACTIVE) is driven by BUFG_PS clock buffer system_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/U0/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG. It should be reconnected in parallel to the driving clock buffer in order to reduce skew. Cascaded buffers introduce skew that can lead to difficult or impossible timing closure.
Related violations: <none>
